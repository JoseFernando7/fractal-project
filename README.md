Fractals are intricate, self-similar patterns found in nature and mathematics. These geometric shapes repeat at every scale, creating stunning visuals from the tiniest details to the grandest scales. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, fractals have practical applications across various fields:

ðŸŒ¿ **Nature & Biology:** Understanding natural patterns like coastlines, mountain ranges, and plant growth.

ðŸ“ˆ **Finance:** Modeling complex market behaviors and stock price movements.

ðŸ“¡ **Technology:** Improving signal compression and network design.

ðŸŽ¨ **Art & Design:** Creating captivating and infinitely complex designs.

From enhancing data analysis to inspiring innovative designs, fractals demonstrate the fascinating intersection of mathematics and the real world.

## Project Information

This project made in python with numpy and turtle shows how fractals can also generate coasts since they follow the fractals laws.
